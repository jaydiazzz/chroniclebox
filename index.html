            <div id="img"></div>
            <p>Chronicle is an online subscription box that allows for our customers to also purchase our items in singularity. Allowing for our customers to always get what they want when they want. Tired of receiving items from your subscription box that you don't want? Chronicle is there to help solve that problem with our vast majority of brands.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="howy">
            <h2>How it works</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Subscribe to our box and be redirected to take our survey which includes, your sizes, the amount of times you would like the subscription boxes sent, and the option to opt into our shaving program which allows us to send shaving accessories to you.</li>
                <li>After subscribing, we send you a box based on your survey. If you ordered before the 15th we ship it on the 15th, if you ordered after, we ship it on the 1st, simple right?</li>
                <li>If you like it we'll keep sending it! If it's not your thing then you can opt out, but I mean... who would want to.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Who Are We?</h1>

                <div>
                    <div class="circle one"></div>
                    <p>We're a small business located in Fresno, California. One day we were faced with problem of how could we ever solve the annoying store visits, the problamatic single item subscription boxes, the vast majority of where to find the right clothes. And then we got it. We figured why not make something to deal with this probem? Which then led to the creation of Chronicle.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div class="circle two"></div>
                    <p>Our boxes include clothing, clothing accessories, fragrances, and the optional razors and razor accessories. Our many accessories include, but are not limited to, watches, hats, shaving cream, and shaving balm. This solves the problem of constant ordering of multiple items by combining them into one!</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div class="circle three"></div>
                    <p>So what's the big deal? Why can't I just go and buy these things to my own individual liking, you may be asking. Chronicle solves you having to go to seperate stores, the annoying trends that are meant to be kept up with, and you can do it all from the comfort of your home trusting you can get trusty and reliable products without no worries in your head.</p>
