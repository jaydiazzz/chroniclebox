				<h2>Top 10 Classic Halloween Costumes</h2>
				<p>Whether you are teen or an adult, you can still dress up for Halloween! Especially if you plan on going to a Halloween party and showing your Halloween spirit. So here are some top ten original Halloween costumes that you can wear to show you spirit on Halloween night. So let’s take a look at these 10 creepy classics that you can be for Hallow Eve’s Night.</p>
				<h3>Disclaimer: This list is not in any particular order, it is just a list of the top ten classic Halloween costumes.</h3>
				<h3>1. Werewolf</h3><br>
				<p>The Werewolf is one of the most iconic symbols of Gothic movies and Halloween. It’s been in folklore for a long time, which makes it all the spookier! A modern day Werewolf has a much more aggressive and scary look to it, which is perfect if you want to scare somebody. Although that doesn’t mean that you can’t switch it up and stick with the classic Wolfman look. Both are great looks for a party. You can either scare some people and have a good laugh, or be friendly and have a good time. Be careful when fighting kids though, because remember Wolfman does have nards! Those that get it know what I’m referencing.</p>
				
				<h3>2. Zombie</h3><br>
				<p>Another perfect classic costume is a Zombie! Although the whole vibe and essence of a Zombie has changed, you can still dress as the classic thriller. A cool thing about the original Zombie is that they remember how to do everything that they did when they were alive, the only thing that’s different is that they’re dead and hungry for flesh. I know it must be shocking for TWD fans, that the dead do more than just walking. So if you want, you can be a Zombie and make it the Night of the Living Dead. </p>
				<h3>3. Vampire</h3><br>
				<p>Why not be a classic Vampire and suck in as much fun as you can throughout the night! Now I want to make it clear that I’m not talking about any twilight vampires because we don’t  mess with that . I’m talking about the good Vampires like the Count Dracula type of Vampires, the real blood suckers. Maybe though, if you want to go further back in the evolutions of Vampires, you could be Nosferatu. Either would be perfect for you to party as from Dusk Till Dawn. </p>
				
				<h3>4. Frankenstein's Monster</h3><br>
				<p>Although many call him Frankenstein, that is his father’s name. This lovable monster is actually referred to as Frankenstein’s Monster. If you want something simple but shows a lot of the Halloween spirit, then this is the costume for you. Frankenstein's Monster is a classic monster that has such a deeper meaning to the character. He shows that you shouldn’t be afraid of the unknown because it could be harmless and shows how evil people can be when it comes to things beyond their understanding. Not to mention, he knows a thing or two about the Monster Mash. If you dress as this boogie beast, you’ll keep the dance floor aliiiiive all night!</h3>
			
			<h3>5. Ghostface</h3><br>
			<p>Ghostface isn’t really much a “classic” classic, but the character is a classic nonetheless. Ghostface is the famous alias used for many antagonist throughout the cult classic slasher series named Scream. This costume is perfect if you want to really scare or creep people out. Fun Fact: In the beginning of the first movie, when Ghostface asked his victim what her favorite scary movie is, was a set-up for a one liner put in by the late director Wes Craven. She proceeds to say that her favorite scary movie was Nightmare on Elm Street but she felt that the rest sucked. This is because Wes Craven directed and wrote the first Nightmare on Elm Street but did not want any sequels, but the studio had decided to capitalize on sequels without Wes. Well I guess that’s Hollywood for you. Also If you want to be a ghost without the face, then you can go with the most simplest and most classic costume by wearing a white bed sheet and out eyes wholes and become a SPOOKY ghost!</p>
			
			<h3>6. Clown</h3><br>
			<p>I feel that this photo is appropriate since, the remake of the classic horror movie “IT” came out last month.  Actually it’s more of a prequel, unless they actually do a remake of the original movie. Although you should be careful on what look you go with being a clown because of the whole creepy clown trend that just… won’t die already. Maybe go with a friendly look if you are going to to be around kids or at a party. You can go with the creepy clown look though if you plan on scaring people and stealing candy from some kids on Halloween. It doesn’t matter what kind of style you go with though, both are equally creepy. What’s your favorite clown movie?</p>
			
			<h3>7. Superhero</h3><br>
			<p>Even though Superheroes have been very popular lately, especially in movies… it hurts me, that a majority of people don’t realize how classic these heroes really are. Comics became really popular during the 80’s and 90’s as they were adapted into movies, but did you know that these heroes have been around since before WWII! There is such a variety of superheroes that you can dress up as for Halloween, if you want to be spooky then you can dress up as the cape crusader. Maybe if you want to get really classic with the superhero that you choose, you can be Superman. The first hero to come to life and the pinnacle of what it means to be a hero. There’s also the Hulk, Ironman, Flash, and Captain America. The possibilities are truly endless. Remember though, with great power comes great responsibility. </p>
			
			<h3>8. Pirate</h3><br>
			<p>Argh matey! If it’s a costume that you seek, then it’d be a pirate that you be. A pirate is one of the most classic tales ever told. Stealing great treasures and riding the waves of the open seas. Why not dress up as a swashbuckling buccaneer and steal the attention on the dance floor. You can be any kind of pirate and it’s a good thing that we’re not shy of a variety of popular pirates. Your pirate costume can range from Captain Hook to the fearsome BlackBeard.</p>
			
			<h3>9. Prisoner</h3><br>
			<p>A prisoner is a very classic costume for Halloween. They were pretty big back then in cult and suspenseful movies. We all know how it goes, you got the Jock and the good girl at lookout point or whatever your city calls it. Then all of a sudden!...As the Jock goes in for the kiss to start the night off, the radio speaks about an escaped inmate near where they are. The Jock brushes it off as the girl says she wants to leave and he goes in for the kiss again but then!... The inmate stabs him! Well the escaped prisoner is perfect because when you’re asked what you were “arrested” for then you can come up with anything. A bonus would be if someone was a police officer.</p>
			
			<h3>10. Grim Reaper</h3><br>
			<p>One of the Scariest and spookiest entities to ever live among our folklore and stories is the Grim Reaper. He is the embodiment of death and passage to the afterlife. Nothing is scarier than facing death! Ooooh, I’m getting chills just thinking about it! So why not scare people in the afterlife, especially if you’re going to some crazy halloween parties.</p>
			<br>
			<p>That’s it, hope you enjoyed these top ten classic Halloween costumes. Hopefully you consider to dress up as some of these creepy classics. Be ready because soon we’re coming out with an article about the history of Hallow's Eve Night and maybe some spooky tales. Next week though, we’ll be back with the top ten movies to watch on Halloween Night if you plan for a night in, so make sure to stayed tuned for some more Chronicle Content!</p>
